# Dual booting Windows 11 and Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS on my laptop.
## Update: when moving to university, I installed Linux again on my second laptop. My main currently runs Windows 11 only.
Why I got rid of the dual boot option on my main: <br>
- Switiching between each OS was inefficient. <br>
- Windows 11 has better compatibility with Microsoft 365 Office, which I mainly use for university.

<br>
However, running Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS on my second laptop has its advantages. The Linux terminal is superior to Windows. With less bloatware, the overall performance and battery life is much better. It is an older Lenovo T-series brought back to life.
