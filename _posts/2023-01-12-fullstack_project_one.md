### Objective
        Developed and deployed a dynamic website with a search feature.
        Enables users to access a database of movies, including
        an archive tab for viewing previous movie information.
        Utilized AWS for cloud computing services.
        

        
### Description
This website, a MERN stack project, is a three-tier architecture and one of my most ambitious projects to date.
Provided a seamless browsing experience through a smooth and dynamic user interface, users can easily search for their
favorite movies on the website.
Connected to a database with a size of approximately 337.5 MB, software improvements
in resource fetching efficiency will enable it to become a powerful search search engine in the future.
